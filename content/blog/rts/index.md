# Synopsis

[Road To Success](https://rtsutah.com/) (RTS) is an online platform whose goal is to foster literacy and a love of learning in elementary and middle-school students.

Prior to our engagement, RTS had been operating for 17 years as a paper-based program. Teachers sent their students home with a reading tracker for their parents to fill out and sign. Upon returning the paper, students would be given a small reward, e.g. a pencil, eraser, or sticker.

While the program had seen a generation or more of success, the times had changed. The program directors originally simply wanted a way for teachers and parents to record their student's progress online.

Instead, we turned it into an app that gamifies reading through through various levels to motivate (and track) student achievement. The program directors saw the vision and scalability of what we proposed and were able to sell the idea to additional investors. For roughly 2-years' cost of running the program and providing the pencil-and-erase rewards in 5 school districts, we were able to design and build the game that is now used in every school district in Utah.

While students are given motivation beyond simple rewards, their parents can now track their children's reading; teachers can see a roll-up of their classes or dig into individual students; administrators and principals can similarly see school-wide data or drill down to classes and students; and superintendents can see it all plus a district-wide view. What is returned is a wealth of data that can be correlated with aptitude tests and student progress metrics.

The excitement of the app spread, and we were ultimately able to extend the features to allow for community businesses to donate prizes and other donations to reward the students in a end-of-year raffle for every school.

**Users**

- Primary: K-8th students
- Secondary: Teachers, Parents
- Tertiary: Principals, librarians, and other administrators

## Goal

Identify student, teacher, and parent needs.

Balance these competing needs to create an app that improves student reading habits while reducing the load on teachers and parents to track students' progress manually.


## Method

1. Stakeholder research
2. User research
    - Students
    - Parents
    - Educators
    - Local business owners
3. Competitive analysis
4. Design sprints
    - World building
    - Reward system
    - In-game and out-of-game economy
    - Community donation platform
    - Visuals and prototypes
5. Developer consulting
6. User testing


## Outcome

The new motivation and reward strategy for students:

1. In-app badges, character customization, and level progress
2. Great looking graphics
3. Community business can donate rewards, e.g. local restaurants offer the school 1,000 coupons for a free or discounted meal
    
Other businesses donate toys and other gifts that are raffled off throughout the year. 
    
Every student participates in drawings for the prizes; the more they read, the more tickets they have entered in the raffle
    

## Benefits

Overall, this strategy for community involvement provides several benefits:

- students are more engaged in tracking their reading behavior and progress
- students behaviors (minutes read, Lexile scores) can be correlated with standardized test to guide educators
- educators and parents are not concerned by the platform, since its simplicity is not overly engaging each that it takes precedent over the true goal of improving student reading
- local business receives a tax break for its donation
- it can publicize its participation toward positive brand perception among the public
- it attracts in-store visits that result in more sales, since family members will typically accompany the young student and purchase additional items beyond the coupon value
- the non-profit can now redirect the monetary donations it previously used to buy trinkets and instead iterate on and improve the app experience
- the students receive rewards that motivate them far more than a pencil or sticker
- parents and educators are happy to see kids become motivated to read and can easily recognize progress in individual students, as well as discover issues in both individual children and larger groups (classrooms, grades, schools, etc.). This information improves their ability to intervene more quickly to address problems
- the non-profit now has a proof-of-concept that they can leverage to expand into more states, as well as seek the backing of other na in-profits and NGOs for additional funding to finance its expansion and further improve the application

# Year 2

The initial launch and use over the first year were highly successful in gaining support from educators and the community. Over 260,000 students participated during the inaugural year. That said, only ~20% actually progressed beyond the first level—far below the goal. Analytics and one-on-one interviews with teachers showed that, while the tracker was being used, the motivators were missing the mark. 

As the school year came to a close, the non-profit behind RTS returned to us to extend the game and application features to address some of theses issues. The fact that we had saved them their typical yearly budget spent on physical prizes (amounting to $75,000), they were able to approach us with additional requests—backed as well by more benefactors who saw the potential of the app.

It was at this stage that we devised the community business initiative and portal to encourage them to donate real-world awards. 

This is also the point at which we introduced the concept of a bank account with the ability for students to "pay" for class privileges.

As of mid-year of the second school year, spot interviews with educators noted these motivators had increased student and parent participation.

### v2 Improvements

## Impact

**Increased donations**
The site and gamified app increased the number of community donors significantly. Since launch, I know of two sponsors who have been added.

**Decreased operational costs**
Saved the non-profit organization sponsoring thus build $75,000/year, which had previously been spent on rewards such as pencils and stickers.

**Increased impact** 
The ultimate goal of the non-profit was to create an MVP that could show value so that it could launch in additional states and go to investors such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for further funding.

Engagement (not revenue) is the major KPI here. With this app, the organization was able to expand from a handful of school districts in the immediate Salt Lake City region to nearly every district across the state of Utah.

**Increased organizational stability** 
While the original pen-and-paper tracking method was employed primarily to 1–3 grades, the new app generated enough buzz throughout schools that the majority of districts are using it for K–8th.

**Increase educational value** 
As the product of a non-profit organization, the shareholders are major donors sitting on the board of trustees. Increasing the effectiveness of the app as measured by engagement and improved reading aptitude tests—particularly in economically distressed areas—are the signs of success. The value of their donations is tied directly to the success of the students. By the second engagement a year later, the benchmark test scores of the students were still being gathered. However, user (student, teacher, parent, administrator) response was highly positive, pointing indirectly to a positive impact on all user personas.
