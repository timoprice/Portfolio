## Action

### Method

1. Conduct a true intent survey to identify visitor and donor personas
2. Identify common and distinct persona motivations, expectations and pain points
3. Use the above to create a content strategy that speaks to each persona

## Result

### Outcome

- Researched and createed **user journeys** through the site, reducing friction along the marketing funnel
- Unified the **information architecture + content strategy** across the three organizational divisions' websites
- Created processes and guidance materials for ongoing **content governance**

### Notes

In addition to site strategy, my team an I created page content and visuals for core pages to serve a models for the Red Cross content team.

## Business Impact

#### Decreased operational costs

By reducing the need to maintain unproductive pages that didn't convert. We reduced 100,000+ pages to a set of fewer than 500. To date, the systems and recommendations we provided are [still in use](https://www.redcross.org/).

#### Increased revenue

The American Red Cross derives its revenue from donations (blood, money, and time). Increased donations correlate closely with disasters. Timely, relevant news about disasters and humantiarian aid was shown to motivate visitors. Beyond this, we leveraged the personas and journey maps to reduce friction along the marketing funnel toward the shopping cart.

#### Increased brand value

By unifying 3 disparate organization-centric sites into a single visitor-focused offering with a common set of user journeys.
