# Situation

Prior to engaging us, the [American Red Cross website](https://www.redcross.org/) consisted of three different platforms built hodgepodge over 15+ years. All previous attempts to standardize content, design, and information architecture had long since been abandoned.

As we worked move the content from the old to a new AEM platform, it became clear that the assumed "lift-and-shift" model was not feasible. The pages on the old site were simply not well structured, making it impossible to replatform it to AEM's highly structured requirements.

Recognizing this internally was one thing. Providing evidence to help the client recognize the impact of the issue was a matter of delving into research.

## Challenge

As the request progressed, it became clear that the problem went beyond unstructured content, which was in part only a symptom of a greater problem: publishing content was a chore for the Red Cross marketing and content creator team. 

Over 50 components had been available for use, but only one was actually employed throughout the site—and this was injected with new Javascript to change its behavior and appearance for every occurrence. This complexity meant that content creators had to rely on developers to publish the content, resulting in long delays.

## Effect

In short, the website was a both Wild West of user experience *and* marketing had no possibility to fix it or improve their methods going forward.

Moreover, the lack of consistency, huge site, lack of reliable search capabilities, and delay in providing timely information were eroding trust in the Red Cross brand.

Replatforming to AEM thus provided the perfect to redesign the way the Red Cross content creators publish information, engage users to present relevant content at the right times, and drive visitors to its donation & volunteering conversion funnel.
